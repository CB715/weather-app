# Weather App :sun_with_face:

This is a project to create a weather forecasting application using React.

* Users can see the name and country of the city the forecast is for. The search box can be used to search a new location
* Users can see a summary of each day of the forecast, including the date, general description of the weather that day, and maximum temperature
* Users can click on one of the summaries to view all of the forecasted information for that date

Once installed, simply enter a city into the search bar to begin your search. You can then click any of the forecasted days to view a detailed forecast for that day.

Please note this only currently works for cities within the UK.
